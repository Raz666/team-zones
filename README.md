# Team Zones Monorepo

This repository hosts the Expo mobile app plus future backend and shared packages.

## Structure

- `apps/mobile` - Expo React Native app
- `apps/api` - Backend placeholder (to be implemented later)
- `packages/shared` - Shared TypeScript types/constants (placeholder)

## Install

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
```

## Mobile app

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run mobile:dev
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
npm run mobile:android
npm run mobile:ios
npm run mobile:web
npm run mobile:test
npm run mobile:typecheck
```

You can also run the original scripts directly inside `apps/mobile`.

## Backend (placeholder)

`apps/api` contains a minimal skeleton for upcoming backend work.

## Shared package (placeholder)

`packages/shared` is reserved for platform-neutral TypeScript types/constants.
